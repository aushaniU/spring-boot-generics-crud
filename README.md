# Generics-Based Spring Boot CRUD Application

This project is a Spring Boot application that demonstrates the use of Generics to implement a reusable and scalable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) structure. The project follows a layered architecture with a Generic Service, Repository, and Controller, ensuring better code reusability and maintainability.

## Features
- **Generics-Based CRUD**: Reusable CRUD operations for any entity.
- **Spring Boot**: Rapid application development with Spring Boot.
- **JPA / Hibernate**: Persistence layer for database operations.
- **REST API**: Exposes standard RESTful endpoints for client interaction.
- **MySQL Database**: Used for persistent data storage.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction and managing entities.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for data storage.
- **Lombok**: To reduce boilerplate code for getters, setters, constructors, etc.
- **Maven/Gradle**: Build tool for dependency management.
